# Dagger 2
This is an example of dagger two.  It contains two projects, daggerExample and daggerDecompiled.

DaggerExample is almost identical to the example dagger 2’s github gives and daggerDecompiled is daggerExample,
 but with most of the generated code from dagger 2 decompiled.  The reason why daggerDecompiled exists is so one may use Android
 Studio’s navigation tools to understand the inner workings of dagger 2.
